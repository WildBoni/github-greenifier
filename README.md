# GitHub Greenifier

Make your GitHub greener than a rainforest!

## This project is made just for fun

The author believes that every developer is learning at his own pace and having an "all green" commit timeline shouldn't be the main goal for a developer, nor it represents a way for recruiters to discern between a good and bad candidate. Learn at your own pace, try as hard as you can to be consistent but keep your mental health as your main focus!
