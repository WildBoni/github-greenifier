# GitHub Greenifier

Make your GitHub greener than a rainforest!

## This project is made just for fun

The author believes that every developer learns at their own pace, and having an "all green" commit timeline shouldn't be the main goal for a developer, nor does it represent a reliable way for recruiters to distinguish between good and bad candidates. Learn at your own pace, strive to be consistent, but prioritize your mental health above all!

## Usage

- create a new folder: mkdir my-project
- cd my-project
- git init
- run this package: npx github-greenify
- git add .
- git commit -m "ready to go!"
- push your project to a private repo
- done: your GitHub account will be soooo green!
